Quick and dirty Technical SEO Tip: You can use Chrome to emulate Googlebot. This allows you to see pages as Google does. Here's how:  
  
1. Open up the page you want to view and select Inspect > Element  
  
2. Select the three vertical dots and choose "Show Console Drawer"  
  
3. Choose the next set of vertical dots and click "Network Conditions"  
  
4. In Network Conditions, find "User-Agent". Uncheck the default box and choose "Googlebot Smartphone"  
  
5. Refresh the page, and you'll see how Google views the page  
  
Doing this exercise, you'll find that Googlebot sometimes sees content differently than users do. This is a great exercise for sites that use a lot of JavaScript, single-page apps, or in situations where you might be serving different crawlers.
