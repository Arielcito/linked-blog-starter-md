In 2023, I was struggling with shiny object syndrome, so I decided to put The Jacob's Formula for Success to the test. This formula helped me grow to 30K followers on TikTok.

### The formula

Knowledge or skill + Action + Patience = Success.

This is the basic breakdown, but you can learn more about The Jacob's Formula [here](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/e5ukpzw2ozh7hpo93m3a8h73elw22/dpheh0h050mmnoim/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcmtpYW5hLmNvbS90aGUtamFjb2JzLWZvcm11bGEtZm9yLXN1Y2Nlc3Mv).

I decided to choose something that I knew nothing about, and share my process. I chose spreadsheets: Excel and Google Sheets. At the beginning of the experiment, I had no idea how to use spreadsheets effectively.

### The process

I dedicated a few hours each day to learning. In less than a week, I became so comfortable with spreadsheets that I was making videos to teach others.

The more I made videos, the more I grew and solidified my own understanding. I was posting the same videos on TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube to see how they would behave on each platform.

### The results

- 30K followers on TikTok.
- 19K followers on Facebook.
- 1K subscribers on YouTube.
- A few clients further interested in Excel lessons and templates.

I decided to slow down on spreadsheet videos to focus more on my app, [Codlixe](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/e5ukpzw2ozh7hpo93m3a8h73elw22/owhkhqhror77d7iv/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF5Lmdvb2dsZS5jb20vc3RvcmUvYXBwcy9kZXRhaWxzP2lkPWNvbS5jb2RsaXhlLmFya2lt).

**Ultimately, I learned that if you work on something consistently and patiently for a good amount of time, you cannot lose. People also love learning along with you, so leverage that for growth!**
