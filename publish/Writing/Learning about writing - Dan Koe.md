**1) Choose A Topic You Can’t Shutup About**

Don’t overthink this just yet. Pick a topic and practice writing.

It can be productivity, creativity, spirituality, fitness, or any of the interests you could hold a conversation with.

If you are already writing, use one of your topics from [your topic tree](https://thedankoe.com/letters/dont-get-replaced-by-ai-how-to-write-authentic-content/).

**2) Brainstorm Your Unique Perspective**

Forget everything you know about “value.”

Actionable advice and platitudes don’t sell as well as they did when the internet was just budding.

Novelty catches attention. Attention is a given if you want people to read what you write.

Novel perspectives are the best (and replicable way) to capture attention without using sleazy tactics.

How do you come up with a novel perspective?

Braindump:

- Common problems associated with the topic
- Benefits to overcoming those problems
- Common goals associated with the topic
- Roadblocks to achieving those goals
- Personal experiences you’ve had

Now, piece everything together and _explain it how you would if you were talking to a friend._

Don’t try to copy someones perspective or way of wording things. Say it in your own voice and let it _refine with time, effort, and practice._

**3) Write 500-1000 Words On The Topic Per Week**

You need a balance of depth and growth.

Meaning, you need long form and short form.

I’m big on starting a newsletter as your long form – but that can wait at the start.

Focus on a platform like X.

Write threads as your long form once a week.

Write 2-3 posts a day.

Then focus on step 5 the most for growth.

I will break down how to write these soon.

**4) Deconstruct & Simplify Ideas For Daily Posts**

Writing long-form gives you multiple ideas to pull from.

Don’t try to copy-paste posts from your newsletters or threads – _rewrite them as standalone short posts._

We will discuss this throughout the letter.

**5) Learn How To Get Your Writing Shared (Crucial)**

Your writing means nothing if nobody sees it.

This is a huge beginner trap.

They think they can write all day and hope that our lord and savior the algorithm will make them an overnight success.

No. Writing is 20% of the equation. Traffic is 80%.

You get traffic on your profile and writing through replies, networking, and shares.

I break down every possible way to do this in the [How To Actually Grow On Social Media letter.](https://thedankoe.com/letters/how-to-actually-grow-on-social-media-what-they-dont-tell-you/)

**6) Monetize Your Experience**

Now that you have writing, a growing audience, and traffic – the only thing left to do is create a product or service to monetize.

We discussed all possible options in last weeks letter.

All of this is what we teach in [Kortex University](https://university.kortex.co/) – where an overwhelming amount of students saw audience growth (some getting past the big 1K follower number) this week.
