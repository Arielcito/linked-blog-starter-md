1. Experiment tweets (with takeaways): If you do something cool, track the results, and share the learnings - people will always like your content.

This is how some of the biggest tech influencers have grown on Twitter.

The only problem? you can’t experiment enough to post every day.

2. Authority tweets (“Look at me, I’m cool“): These are the tweets that prove you are worth following.

A little bragging goes a long way.

Generated $X revenue?
Managed Y number of people?
Sold a company for $Z in 5 years?

Tweet about it!

The tweets that have gotten me the most followers are the ones where I share a success of mine.

Coincidence? I think not.

What do I comment?
When starting, you’ll get much more visibility by commenting on people's content instead of tweeting (btw, that’s what Tweet Hunter and Taplio are making very easy to do).

So do it, A LOT. And it’s super easy.

Just comment like you are talking to a friend.

> Be funny
> Share an opinion
> Give a compliment

Yep, that’s it.

+ With AI reply bots so active, standing out is extremely easy anyway.

Be cool, make friends, and grow together.

Pro tip: Engaging consistently with the same people is better than randomly. Because they start noticing you and are much more willing to engage back and support you in what you’re doing.
