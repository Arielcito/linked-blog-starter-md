4 ways you can improve your productivity writing code:  
  
1. GitHub Copilot for auto-completion  
2. ChatGPT for personalized code generation  
3. Perplexity AI for answering questions  
  
But there's something else I've slowly started adding to my workflow:  
  
An AI-powered agent that can help you describe, review, classify, test, and document your pull requests.  
  
The name of the tool is PR-Agent. It's open-source, and you can find it here:

Here are some of the things this tool will do for you:  
  
1. It will suggest documentation, unit tests, and improvement per code component.  
  
2. It will save you from embarrassing bugs and other issues if you don't notice them when coding.  
  
3. It will generate a pull request walkthrough, making it easy for the reviewer.  
  
This is a great use of AI. If you are a developer, you should check it out.
